      <h3>About Mitch Nick</h3>
      <h5>Ruby and AngularJS Developer</h5>
      <hr>
      <p>
        <img alt="Mitch Nick" class="photo-with-text text-center"
          src="public/images/mitch_pic.jpg">
        My name is Mitch Nick and I'm a full stack developer who builds web applications in Ruby and AngularJS, with a
        preference for Ruby on Rails. My career started at Deloitte tailoring Sales and Marketing technologies for
        really large companies. In my free-time there I set the vision which overhauled Deloitte's global and US
        innovation programs. In 2012, I left to focus 100% on programming and haven't looked back.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work on all sorts of projects - whether you are a new startup looking to get an MVP off the ground or an
        established company looking to add some development capacity.
      </p>
      <ul class="text-left">
        <li>
          <strong>Early Startups:</strong>
          I can help guide you through the early stages of project planning, understand your users needs, develop the
          information architecture and overall user experience, find the right design to leverage for your website and
          finally build out the working product. I'm especially talented at helping set the vision for the MVP, allowing
          your application to get to paying customers as fast as possible.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <strong>Shopify App Development:</strong>
          I have my second Shopify App getting ready to launch on the Shopify App Store. I can help you translate your
          business idea for the App store and build a custom app which will be accessible for all 800,000 stores on
          Shopify.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>I'm currently working remotely, but my previous home was Minneapolis. Wherever I am, I try to help people
        understand Nick can be a last name.</p>
      <hr>
      <h5>My philosophy: Save clients time and money without sacrificing quality</h5>
      <p>I believe in leveraging existing web frameworks and our previous code versus rebuilding the wheel from scratch.
        This saves my clients both time and money. Need a login which incorporates Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn for
        your site? This is more of a copy and paste problem versus starting completely from scratch. Looking for a
        website which is easy for you to administer and add content to in the future? I'll pull in an established and
        well maintained Ruby gem (re: add-on / extension) to create the backend administration site in just a couple of
        hours. Looking to get an MVP off the ground? We'll build out a rough wireframe and leverage a beautiful design
        on wrapbootstrap. Looking to build a mobile app? Let's leverage Ionic so we have one codebase which creates an
        iOS and Android app.</p>

                  willingness to listen when other people’s opinion was different from his own. With me, Mitch’s
                  communication was right where it needed to be. He brought the appropriate questions to the right
                  people, and kept his questions for me to the strategic variety. He also did a good job of pestering me
                  when he needed me to look at something, which is appreciated and can be needed at times in a project.
                </h1>
                <h1>Mitch’s code was well organized and he did a great job of test coverage. His approach to solving
                  problems was a nice balance of not being too complex or too simple; he didn’t jump through hoops he
                  didn’t need to. Speaking to the Full Stack, from some hard core database issues to javascript issues,
                  Mitch did a great job of jumping in. If there was an issue he didn’t know how to solve, he had a great
                  approach for trying to figure out a solution. Whether it involved learning or getting other people
                  involved, he was always great at troubleshooting.</h1>
                <h1>Overall, Mitch is great to work with and would definitely love to hire him again.</h1>

                    <p>Ideal Energies installs solar panels across the state of Minnesota. They were having a difficult
                      time keeping track of all of their installations. We built a custom website to not only manage
                      their installations, but to help run their entire business. We pull in data from their solar
                      panels (two different APIs) nightly to analyze which sites are performing as expected and what
                      sites need an onsite visit for service.</p>

                  put the project into terms all members of our team, including those with limited tech backgrounds,
                  could understand. Once we started working together, he set us up with the tools necessary to keep

                  been extremely useful in our everyday work. He definitely helped us reach our main goal of taking 50%
                  of our work out of the inbox. I can only imagine as we continue, the tool will bring our company even

      <h5>Working with groups</h5>
      <p>
        Even though I work as an independent programmer, I find myself working in groups a large portion of the time.
        Leveraging git, it has never been easier for a team of programmers to work on an application together and
        deliver you an outstanding end product. Depending on your project needs and timeline, there are numerous
        different people I enjoy working with.
